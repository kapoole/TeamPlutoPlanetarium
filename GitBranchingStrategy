## Branch Structure
feature branch -> staging branch (staging) -> live branch (main)

staging branch and live branch will only have merge commits
feature branch will have individual progress commits

Both Staging Branch and Live Branch would have protected ruleset

## Commits

Commit frequently and small commits
Small working pieces of code as checkpoint
- can be Work in Progress but best to note WIP in commit message

ie. Add 30 Character Limit to Login Form
Multiline commits are very useful


Consistent, well-documentated, for others to read
